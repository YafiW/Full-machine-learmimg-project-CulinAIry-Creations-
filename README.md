# Machine-learning-full-project
## An artificial intelligence project to create customized recipes.
The project is built by a client - React.
Server side - Python.
The user chooses selected products that he has at home through the screen.
The selected products are sent to a Python server,
The server classifies the products using an AI code and an appropriate classification model for the appropriate category for these products.
After the appropriate category has been selected for the products chosen by the user, the algorithm filters out suppliers that are not relevant for this category and for the remaining products it creates an appropriate amount for each product with the help of a adversarial network model.
The user receives back the products suitable for the created recipe together with appropriate quantities and relevant preparation instructions for this category.
